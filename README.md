### go build

```shell
go build github.com/wlcn/yq-colly/common
```

Or, if you are working in the package's source directory, just:

```shell
go build
```

### go install

```shell
go install github.com/wlcn/yq-colly/common
```

### go test
Then run the test with go test:

```shell
go test github.com/wlcn/yq-colly/common
ok  	github.com/wlcn/yq-colly/common 0.165s

As always, if you are running the go tool from the package directory, you can omit the package path:

```shell
go test
ok  	github.com/wlcn/yq-colly/common 0.165s
```
